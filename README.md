# Ali_Khatami_EtherJs4

### Ganache and Networks

Here we will deploy our contract at https://github.com/C191068/Ali-Khatami_Ether.Js3  on a fake blockchain <br>
We gonna be using Ganache by going to this link https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/ as our Javascript VM or fake blockchain <br>

Figure1: Going to the link we will click the ```Download``` button <br>

Figure2: Then we will click ```install``` <br>

Figure3: Then we will click ```QuckStart``` <br>

Figure4: Then we will see it is running fake blockchain on my computer i.e locally <br>

Figure5: If we click the key icon it will come the above pop up showing the private key <br>

In our code what we need at first to do is connnect it to block chain <br>

Figure6: In case of Remix , our smart contract connects to metamask wallet account whicha has connection <br>

to blockchain behind the scenes <br>

Figure7: by going this way we will click ```add network``` <br>

![f31](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs4/assets/89090776/0d5cd92e-c3a2-42fd-9986-cbd319c8232a)

Figure8: if we click the ```Network``` option here we will see the information of various networks <br>

All of the above networks have one thing in common and that is ```RPC URL``` <br>

RPC full form is Remote Procedure Call and it stands for a connection to a blockchain node <br>
that somebody is running <br>

The RPC URL conncts us to make API calls and to interact with blockchain nodes <br>

Blockchain node run with software and some of them expose an API call <br>

Figure9: If we go to this https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum we will see there are instruction sto run our own<br>
blockchain node for real blockchain like Ethereum <br>

Figure10: If we go to our Ganache application we can see that at top there is RPC server which is the <br>

endpoint of our blockchain node <br>
